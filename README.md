# 🖨️ Printer Management System

A scalable, full-featured application designed to monitor and manage printers across an organization. This project outlines a phased approach to building a comprehensive system, from planning and development to deployment and maintenance.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Printer Management System** aims to provide IT staff, administrators, and department heads with real-time insight into printer usage, status, and limits. Through dashboards, automated alerts, and advanced reporting, the system streamlines the management of shared printing resources.

## 🧭 Project Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Discovery & Planning

#### 🔍 Requirements Gathering
- **User Personas**: Administrators, Department Heads, IT Staff
- **Core Features**:
  - Role-based Authentication
  - Real-time Printer Monitoring
  - Data Visualization (usage trends)
  - Report Generation (CSV, PDF)
  - Automated Notifications (low supplies, usage limits)

#### 🧱 Technical Architecture
- **Backend**: Python (Flask or Django) or Node.js (Express)
- **Frontend**: React / Angular / Vue.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Printer Agent**: Lightweight background service to collect print job data and send it to the backend (written in Python or C#)

---

### 🛠️ Phase 2: Development

#### 🖥️ 1. Printer Agent
- Monitors print jobs in real time
- Extracts job data (user, pages, printer, department)
- Sends info to backend via REST API

#### 🌐 2. Backend API & Database
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/printers/status` — Fetch current printer statuses
  - `POST /api/printers/limit` — Set/update paper limits
  - `POST /api/reports/generate` — Generate usage reports
- **Database Collections**:
  - `Printers` — Printer metadata and current usage
  - `Departments` — Department details and usage limits
  - `PrintLogs` — Record of each print job

#### 💻 3. Frontend UI
- **Dashboard**: Displays printer & department info
- **Charts**: Usage trends via Chart.js or D3.js
- **Management Panel**: Admin controls for paper limits and users
- **Report Viewer**: View and export reports

---

### 🚀 Phase 3: Deployment & Maintenance

#### ☁️ Deployment
- **Backend**: Hosted on Google Cloud (GCP)
- **Frontend**: Hosted via Firebase Hosting
- **CI/CD**: Automate builds, testing, and deployments

#### 🔧 Maintenance & Support
- Application performance monitoring
- Bug tracking and logging
- Feedback collection for continuous improvement
- Regular security audits and patching
